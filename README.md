# Svelte SPA with Vite.js

> [!TIP]
> To deploy this project using **GUI-based flow**, navigate to [console](https://console.stacktape.com/create-new-project/git-project-using-console?name=my-stacktape-app&repositoryType=public&repositoryUrl=https://github.com/stacktape/starter-svelte-spa-vitejs)

- simple Single Page Application built using [Vue.js](https://svelte.dev/) and
  [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).
- The project uses a [S3 storage bucket](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/buckets/) to store the application assets
  and a [CDN](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/cdns/) to cache the content at the edge.
- This project includes a pre-configured [stacktape.yml configuration](stacktape.yml).
The configured infrastructure is described in the [stack description section](#stack-description)

## Pricing


- The infrastructure required for this application uses exclusively "serverless", pay-per-use infrastructure. If your load won't get high, these costs will be close to $0.

## 1. Generate your project
To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --starterId svelte-spa-vitejs
```




## 2. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:
- Node.js installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --projectName <<project-name>> --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

`projectName` is the name of your project. You can create it in the console or interactively using CLI.

<br />

| Region name & Location     | code           |
  | -------------------------- | -------------- |
  | Europe (Ireland)           | eu-west-1      |

```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

## 3. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

- Explore the app by visiting **webBucket -> cdnUrl**. URL was printed into console after the deploy.





## 4. Hotswap deploys
- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag which avoids using Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.
```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>> --projectName <<project-name>>
```

## 5. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

  Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
  pipeline and other aspects of your project.

  You can deploy your project to multiple environments (stages) - for
  example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of an project. It consists of your application
  code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

  The configuration for this project is described below.

  ## 1. Resources

  - Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
  - Stacktape resources consist of multiple underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.
### 1.1 Bucket

Hosting bucket contains the built Svelte Single-page application (SPA):

- The built app is automatically uploaded into the bucket as a part of the deployment process.
- [CDN](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/cdns/) is automatically configured in front of the bucket to deliver your
  SPA across the world with minimal latency.
- To ensure that the CDN always serves the newest version of the app, CDN cache is automatically invalidated (flushed)
  after each deployment.

```yml
resources:
  webBucket:
    type: hosting-bucket
    properties:
      uploadDirectoryPath: ./dist
      hostingContentType: single-page-app
```

## 2. Application build hook

To automatically build the application before each deployment, the stacktape configuration contains a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

[Hooks](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/) specify the commands or scripts which are executed
automatically before or after command is executed (i.e every time before the stack is deployed). You can specify
reusable script in [scripts](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) section of config and reference it
inside a hook or inline script/command information directly.

```yml
scripts:
  build:
    # or "yarn build"
    executeCommand: npm run build

hooks:
  beforeDeploy:
    # build project before deploy
    - executeNamedScript: build
```

Scripts specified in [scripts](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) section of config, can be run manually
anytime using `stp script:run` [command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/script-run/).
